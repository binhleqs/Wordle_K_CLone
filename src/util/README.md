# util directory

1. `guess_manager.py`: Contains two classes, `LetterInfo` and `GuessManager`. The   `GuessManager` class keeps track of the information you've gathered based on your guesses, and the list of candidate words that fit that information.
2. `probabilities.py`: Contains one class, `Probabilities`. This class provides utility functions that give you statistics / probabilities of words and letters in a given bag-of-words (e.g. how likely is a letter to be in a given index).
